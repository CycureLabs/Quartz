# Quartz - An automatic exploit generator


### :heavy_exclamation_mark: This project is under-development right now, so don't expect it to run right away. :heavy_exclamation_mark:

[Quartz](https://cycurelabs.com/quartz) is an automatic exploit generator tool, powered by Cycure Labs. This tool is inspired by a project done in Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh i.e. AEG (Automatic Exploit Generator). Although the source code or even the executable was never released in public, just some white papers on how they made this possible.

## Expectations :heart_eyes:

  - Compatible with every programming language.
  - Able to create chains and effective exploits. 
  - And to do magics.

## Reality :sweat_smile:

  - We developed this tool in keeping C language in mind.
  - Don't know about chains and all, didn't tried or simply had no idea how we could achieve this.


# Contributions :grinning:

Want to contribute? Great!

Contributions are most welcome, we open-sourced this project for this same reason. We believe open source can make this thing a reality. You can contribute in many ways:
  - By sharing some of your code.
  - By killing some annoying bugs.
  - Providing some graphics, as we are very bad at it.

And we would love to give credits to all the contributors, to this project.

### For developers :computer:

It would be so much help, if you keep this things in mind:

* Add some comments in your code.
* Add your name on top of your code, would help us to manage things.

### Installation :zap:

It's currently under development phase, let's see how it builds out.

```sh
$ sudo wait 2018
```
